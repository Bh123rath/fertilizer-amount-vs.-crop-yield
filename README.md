🚜 **Data Meets Agriculture!** 🌾

I recently explored how **Polynomial Regression** can be applied to analyze the relationship between **fertilizer usage** and **crop yield**. Using Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn), I built a model that goes beyond a straight-line fit by capturing the **non-linear patterns** in agricultural data.

🔍 **Workflow at a glance**

* Loaded real-world data from an Excel file 📊
* Applied **PolynomialFeatures (degree=2)** to include both linear and quadratic terms
* Trained a **Linear Regression model** on the transformed features
* Visualized the results with a **scatter plot (data points)** and a **red regression curve** 🌈

✨ **Why Polynomial Regression?**
Because crop growth doesn’t always increase linearly with fertilizer input. Beyond a point, yield may plateau or decline — and polynomial regression helps capture this realistic trend.

📈 This small project shows how **machine learning can empower smarter agriculture**, ensuring optimal resource use and better decision-making for farmers.

# 🌾 Polynomial Regression: Fertilizer vs Crop Yield

This project demonstrates how to use **Polynomial Regression** with Python to model the relationship between **fertilizer application (kg/hectare)** and **crop yield (tons/hectare)**.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **NumPy & pandas** → Data handling
* **Matplotlib** → Data visualization
* **scikit-learn** → Polynomial regression model

## 📊 Workflow

1. Load dataset from an Excel file (`Fertilizers.xlsx`).
2. Extract independent variable (`Fertilizer`) and dependent variable (`Yield`).
3. Apply `PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)` to include quadratic terms.
4. Fit a `LinearRegression` model on the transformed data.
5. Visualize results:

   * Blue scatter points → actual data
   * Red curve → polynomial regression fit

## 📷 Output

The model produces a curve that captures **non-linear growth patterns**, providing a more realistic picture of how fertilizer impacts yield compared to simple linear regression.
